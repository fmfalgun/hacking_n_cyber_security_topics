# NFC Protocol Security

> **Status**: Coming Soon - This section will be developed after completing other wireless protocols.

## Overview

This section will contain comprehensive NFC (Near Field Communication) protocol analysis and attack implementation guides for contactless communication security testing.

## Planned Content

### Protocol Analysis
- [ ] NFC protocol overview (ISO/IEC 14443, ISO/IEC 18092)
- [ ] Operating modes (reader/writer, peer-to-peer, card emulation)
- [ ] Data exchange formats (NDEF)
- [ ] Communication flow and timing
- [ ] Security features and limitations

### Attack Categories
- [ ] **Eavesdropping**: Signal interception, data capture
- [ ] **Relay Attacks**: Man-in-the-middle relaying
- [ ] **Cloning**: Tag duplication, credential theft
- [ ] **Fuzzing**: Malformed data injection, crash testing
- [ ] **Payment Fraud**: Contactless payment attacks

### Implementation
- [ ] Tools: Proxmark3, ACR122U, NFC-tools, libnfc
- [ ] Hardware requirements
- [ ] Scripting basics for NFC operations
