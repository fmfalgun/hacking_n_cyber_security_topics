# Zigbee Protocol Security

> **Status**: Coming Soon - This section will be developed after completing BLE and WiFi research.

## Overview

This section will contain comprehensive Zigbee protocol analysis and attack implementation guides for IoT device security testing.

## Planned Content

### Protocol Analysis
- [ ] Zigbee protocol stack overview
- [ ] IEEE 802.15.4 physical layer
- [ ] Network layer and routing
- [ ] Application layer profiles
- [ ] Security mechanisms (AES-128 encryption, keys)

### Attack Categories
- [ ] **DoS Attacks**: Channel jamming, network flooding, coordinator attacks
- [ ] **MITM Attacks**: Device impersonation, key interception
- [ ] **Injection Attacks**: Command injection, replay attacks
- [ ] **Sniffing**: Network discovery, key extraction, traffic analysis
- [ ] **Device Exploitation**: Firmware vulnerabilities, insecure pairing

### Implementation
- [ ] Scripting basics for Zigbee packet crafting
- [ ] Tools: KillerBee, Scapy, Wireshark, ATUSB, Ubertooth
