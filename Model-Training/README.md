# Model Training & Analysis

> **Status**: Coming Soon - This section will be developed after completing BLE attack implementation.

## Overview

This section will contain:
- Feature engineering from packet captures
- Model architectures for behavioral analysis
- Training procedures and hyperparameter tuning
- Evaluation metrics and validation strategies
- Continuous monitoring integration

## Planned Content

- [ ] Feature extraction from BLE/WiFi/Zigbee packets
- [ ] Model selection (Random Forest, LSTM, Transformer, etc.)
- [ ] Training pipelines and automation
- [ ] Performance evaluation frameworks
- [ ] Real-time inference deployment
- [ ] Alert generation and threshold tuning
